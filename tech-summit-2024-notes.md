software energy efficiency 

reporting and labels are related and not the intire same thing

difference betweeen lable ( energy label) 

we should report of the use phasse 70% of the energy consumption

Life-Cycle Assesment (Scope 3) 

policy and decisions have an influence 


- IT and developers have an impact on ernergy

- emissions associated with the user 
 _ via internet data center to users 
- how is the entire information cycle 

model this 
- how are the users using the system and number of users 


essential task 
fridge has energy label
car has a energy label
by the functionality of the software

scalabilty 

process model is the infrastrucute 

consider end users network and datacenters

what if not linear and not linear in other paets

is a bad situtauituon

if occruse that non uniform liniaroty
do ranges what is aversge energy cinsumption 
world wide system 
- end users a bit different

CPU -> is own i
devices matters


project:

roskilde university 


look at end user devices 
upload and download of files
device consumption


noveltygraph -> setup a functional R 
provide measurement 

compare different cloud system -live system

CopenCloud 
IDrive 
onedrive
dropbox

define end user task 
with companys case 
essential user functions
definition : 
  UPLOAD A FILE 
  copy rename 
  delete 

using lab to make measurements

comparablitiy / of different cloud solutions 
what is a fair comparison 

super users - > record   click and align
standardize how to click through
calculating cognitive load -> slove down the process
web based version
automation scripts

first measuremnt : 
 - 


system tasks 
by system iwners - > essential task
define boundaries
