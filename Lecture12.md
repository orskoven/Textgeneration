Principal component analysis

RAW Notes : Should be transformed ->Z 

[¬†Jump in : henrik explains to output nodes _> when discussion of 
Softmax always the sum of 1 of a probability distribution -> and get a confidence in the result number / result -> you get to paramtric probabilty distribution in your output the probability sum is always 100 and when you have two output nodes in a binary classification _> so you have node1: 0.8 being a cat and node2:0.2 not a dog 

TWO OUPUT NODES WITH A SOFTMAX -> SOFTMAX MAKES PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION and can be interpreted as confidenc->

### üìö Key Concepts
| Concept        | Description/Definition                                     | Example/Context                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Bibliography   | Find google scholar to generate latex bibliography         |        |
| weights      | Generated randomely connecting line between perceptrons : reson being random : floats can give os better information as small numbers around zero                           | Example or context to illustrate       |
| Fully conected network       | All nodes are connect from input to hidden to ouput layer                            | input circles connected to hidden to output layer are all connected on each other by lines that canno extend layers       || Nodes      | input are clean input : hidden layer notes have a sum function and activatoin function ( sum function multiplies each weight from the corresponding node in the previos layer and uses the activation to scale the right weighting when we cannot make a polynomial decision boundary                          | Example or context to illustrate       || Activation function       | important                             | Example or context to illustrate       |
