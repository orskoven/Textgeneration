RAW Notes : Should be transformed ->Z 

[¬†Jump in : henrik explains to output nodes _> when discussion of 
Softmax always the sum of 1 of a probability distribution -> and get a confidence in the result number / result -> you get to paramtric probabilty distribution in your output the probability sum is always 100 and when you have two output nodes in a binary classification _> so you have node1: 0.8 being a cat and node2:0.2 not a dog 

TWO OUPUT NODES WITH A SOFTMAX -> SOFTMAX MAKES PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION and can be interpreted as confidenc-> 


More than two ouput nodes are not needed for binary classification 


MUST BE PRINTED TO BRAIN -> GROUND KNOWLEDGE FOR EXAM


CNN's: 

    - convolutional neual networks

 
 ###Features extraction : CNN is ment for image data -> and are really good at that 


    consists of poolings and convolutions -> look at a little area in picture 
    pooling layer : feauture extraction from convultional layer 
                      -> try to enforce strongest signals and turn down weekeast 



        The outlining layers : will take care of contrasts ->
               innner is more detailed the longer we approach the inner layers

            

### Features will become input to classfication network 

MNIST -> steril data that benefit smaller from features extraction

Feature extraction is a strong toolset in terms of picture data 



    import tensorflow as tf
    import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

    (ds_test, ds_val, ds_train), ds_info = tfds.load(
        'mnist',
        split = [ 'test', 'train[0%:17%]


### input image 

convelutional kernel -> scans each picture pixel a small piece of the picture at the time -> 

### MAX Pooling reduces the and filters square don and uses stride 2 reduces 4 x 4 to 2 x 2

### üìö Key Concepts
| Concept        | Description/Definition                                     | Example/Context                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Bibliography   | Find google scholar to generate latex bibliography         |        |
| weights      | Generated randomely connecting line between perceptrons : reson being random : floats can give os better information as small numbers around zero                           | Example or context to illustrate       |
| Fully conected network       | All nodes are connect from input to hidden to ouput layer                            | input circles connected to hidden to output layer are all connected on each other by lines that canno extend layers       || Nodes      | input are clean input : hidden layer notes have a sum function and activatoin function ( sum function multiplies each weight from the corresponding node in the previos layer and uses the activation to scale the right weighting when we cannot make a polynomial decision boundary                          | Example or context to illustrate       || Activation function       | important                             | Example or context to illustrate       |
