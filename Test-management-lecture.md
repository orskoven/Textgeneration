Test management class 



Jest -> 


Integration testing-> checking for the integration and checking for consistency NOT for realism -> 




After taking course you be tempted to work as a tester -> test manager -> also a project manager or work closely with the project manager 


How do we manager the test how do we design the strategy  ?

How much test? 
What are we going to test for? 

Risk based testing what business and product are we running 
domain differs -> in terms of what test should be used 
Are we dealing with money, online, 
GDPR, sector regulation, (banking) 
Testing objectives
Exhaustive testing vs focus on critical errors only? 
What is most important for testing -> login! , signup! Payment!
Smaller companies -> no budget? > Implement DevOps -> TDD require experts - 
Real life : we don’t do testing -> Arturo why? We sell to customers-> all customers -> take testing out and not include when customers see budget 
Arturo :> why do you want bad software? -> from class -> some companies you should 
Big decide between small and big companies -> 
Small companies -> doing some testing -> 
Startup -> no testing -> that are looking to be 
Arturo is developing faster -> and is working for Arturo-> 
Test monitoring control 
Act on deviations 
MONITOR :
PERCENTAGE OF TEST ENVIRONMENT PREPARED 
PERCENTAGE OF TEST CASES PREPARED VS PLANNED
NUMBER OF TEST CASES
RUN NOT RUN 
PASSED FAILED 
NUMBER AND DENSITY OF DEFECTS FOUND 
TEST COVERAGE
COSTS 
HOW OFTEN FAILS TO PIPLINE
What to do when fails -> waterfall _> Arturo : complete disaster -> project manager worked alone for. Weeks -> gant chart -> hired analyst
Hired programmer.> people got sick -> incidents -> internet on of -> electricity-> gant chart is regrid 
What to do when screw up 
Re prioritize tasks 
Review risks 
Change test schedule
Adjust testing scope 
TEST activities will fall behind 
DRAASTIC decisions -> 
Remove non critical - devlivarables
‘
INCIDENT MANAGEMNET .> important .> used in industry -.> also ask exam 
Something unexpected happen -> 
no electricity : incident .-> have to do something about it -> what to do to prevent -> 
9/11 -> no bankruptcy -> continuity center -> database application -> and other team could replace -> human most valid -> they managed well 
IEEE 1044
TOOLS :> jira ,. Bugzilla, azure devops server

	CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT 

	
> what is it? 
Configure environment for testing -> acceptance test many mistakes 
Version2 of a test suite .-> version control to everything related to test 
Regression testing -> run test again -> can be documented and versioned 
BIDIRECTIONAL TRACEABILITY 
Through code test and vice versa test code traceable 


RISK MANAGMENET : 


> RISK 
Risk well being of the project 
Showstopper must also be considered ( could be pain in the hand ) inconsistent windows update 
Then chance of an event, hazard, threat or situation occurring 
Anyhthion 
RISK factor = risk level = probiluty of napping / occuring x impact of it did happen 

TYPES of risk 

> project risk versus product risks 




PROJECT RISKS 

> Management delays 
Inaccurent estimate 
Late changes of additions 
		
		-> technical problems -
wrong definitions
Test environment not ready on time

personnel issues 

inadequate or missing skills
External issues 

		-> legislation changes 



PRODUCT RISKS

defects 
Non functional requirements are not met 
Errors in calculation 
Data integrity issues 
Lack for user validation 

RISK BASED TESTING 


> risks are used to decide 
Where to start
Acceptance test if coder are not experienced
LOOK for vulnarebilties -> and look at v model, 
TEST sign up login risk based testing n
Setting priorities 


RISK CALCULATION _> 

probability 
An impact 

ISTQB give higher number to higher risks and lower number to lower risks 
-> many tester is following istqb 

For easier prioritizesing -> testing principals -> The Pareto -> rule :> is not efficiency according to Arturo 
-> certification useful for test managers - only dicuss project manamgnet 

CERTIFICATION _> gives not practical knowledge -> 

DSTB.dk 
-> member of testing software board ->  CERTIFÝ ISTQB 

1 to 5  -> 1 = low ,, 5 

Medium pro

3 * 5 = 15 


MITIGATION _> checking financial supplier 
Not using supplier 
Using another supplier 
Developing the service internally 
Studying alternatives 
Ensuring payment to the third party is efficient 

Responsible : CFO

Date state: state the date when risk was evaluated e
Follow-up once every month 

Evaluate on impact : for ill 


CONTIUNOUSLY evaluate risk  -> can’t set static risk table 



RISK TABLE : .>


5 is high 1 is low


Space rocket compan vs startup different interpretations 

Losing project participant -> 3 possible / 2 -minor | factor = 6 | COLORS = red problematic Date 
							1 rare / 2 minor | factor 2 | COLORS  = green ok 


Date changes : update next month every risk 


Performance risk -> impact major ->      

Possible -> to unlikely -> rare major -> >> 


Several SNAP SHOTS -> VERSION TABLES _> ONE TABLE - 

TABLE CAN BECOME TOO BIG -> and unable to manage 


RISK is dynamic -> 
update all time 


RISK ID 
RISK NAME 
RISK DISCRIPTION 
Probability 
IMPACT 
RISK FACTOR
MITIGATION
RESPONSIBLE 
STATUS DATE
FOLLOW-up date
STATUS 

SORT BY RISK FACTOR / HIGHES RISK FIRST 
COLOR RISK HIGH : BOLD AND IN RED 
CLOSED RISK SHOULD GO OUT OF THE TABLE 


SLA SIGNING -> HIGH
DATABASE -> HIGH
LACK OF SKILLS -> TAKE COURSE 
INSURANCE POLICY ->

REMEMBER STATES: initial -> finished 


COST  RISK 
SCHEDULE RISK 
PERFORMANCE RISK 

BACKUP 
LOSING PROJECT MANAGER 
IMPORTANT TO ADRESS EVERY RISK EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT THERE 


A LOT OF DOCUMENTATION -> NEEDED HUMBLE TIME -> BACHELOR -> SCRUM OF ONE -> HOW TO APPLY TO ONE PERSON PRJECT 

EXPECTED IN BACHELOR -> TO USE MANAGMENT METHODOLOGY 

IF RISK = 1 -> IS IT worth looking at [ THRESHOL ] 

What does 4 mean for us -> specific project 


SPECIFY RISK TABLES 



Probabilities ->

1 : unlikely yet possible 
2 : potential occurrence 
3 : plausible
4 : might probably
5 : might happen

Impact 



RISK matrix -> GIVE EACH OF THE RISK AN ID -> YOU CAN REFER BACK 

Place risk based on factor -> can immediately see which are high 


VIDEO link : YouTube : RISK AND HOW to use a risk matrix 


What is risk .-> 

Life is full of risk 

Breathing .-> airpollution -Z

Eating -> 

Traveling 


Decision risk we face : 



Events -> appropriate actions 

RISK -> 


		“Risk = likelihood x consequence 


Risk scenario 1 :> bicycle -> one every 5 minute 

				Likelihood is low 
				Consequences low 

				RISK LOW 

SCENARIO 2 -> more bikes  still low risk 


Trucks more frequent -> HIGH X HIGH 

Risk matrix -> consequence X likelihood 




GRID  

  LIKeLOHODE X consequence 


DIFFERENT TYPES Of matrices 

Example: high likelihood expected in most circumstances 
Low likelihood: occurs very rarely 


HAVE LIMITATIONS -> subjective -> time frame into account ->

RISK EXCERSICE 

Promotional website 
 Coding 
Application 
All 

 Register domain 
Four pages on the website 
Active 2025 January 

	-> idenituyfy 
	-> for each 




2 months -> 




EXCERSICE :> Submission : feedback risk matrix and risk table 

HAVE SCALE for assigning probabilty time SCALE is nice Arturo 


GOOD EXAMPLES FROM OTHER: 


If domain is taken

WORK FROM HOME 
Hacker attack  -> pentest -> implement OSWASP 
OWASP GOAT -> 

DVWA GitHub -> damn vulnerable web application


PROMPT ENGINEERING - BASH COURSE SCRIPTING 

SLA service level agreeement .-.> service provider -> 


Dedicated server handler in the team that makes sure server is not exploitable


Arturo hacked twice small server —> hacker bot always active 

Application security  > avoid sql injection 

GitHub security -> 3rd party packages are up to date -> 

Deploy fast and redirect server ->


EXPECTED DELIVER FOR EXAM 

RISK MATRIX _> can be 

Communication skills -> Denmark.> easy to start company .-> or become freelance

CVR easy in Denmark -> startup people trade favors -> marketing expert
Sales- know people .-> well connected .> coffee meeting .> 
Viability -> 

Network 
Exhange -> equity -> 

Money is better than free beer ->
